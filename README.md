My portfolio website.

# Description

A responsive website to display software projects (or other work).  Images, layout, and text change dynamically to accomodate devices with screens of all sizes, from phones to tablets to desktops.

Technology shout-outs to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Grunt, Bootstrap, modals, flex boxes, and .svg images.  I couldn't have done it without you guys!
